### TravelTide: Personalized Rewards Program through Behavioral Segmentation

## 📄 Project Description

🌍 TravelTide is a fast-growing online travel platform committed to delivering exceptional travel experiences to users worldwide. To deepen user engagement and reward loyalty, TravelTide launched a project to design a personalized rewards program based on real user behavior and preferences.

The main objective was to identify active users, analyze their booking patterns, and offer tailored perks that encourage continued platform use. Using SQL-based data extraction, behavioral segmentation, and visualization in Tableau, this project connects user insights with meaningful, data-backed rewards.

## 🧠 Project Summary

This repository documents the full journey from raw session data to perk recommendations.

We began with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of all session and booking data. From there, we filtered the user base to include those with more than 7 sessions since January 4, 2023, resulting in a focused group of 5,998 active users.

Through SQL, we derived several key behavioral and demographic metrics, such as:

🧳 Booking and cancellation rates

✈️ Travel distances and lead times

🛄 Checked bags, session durations, page activity

💸 Discount usage and savings behavior

From these insights, we calculated behavioral indexes like Bargain Hunter Index and Average Dollar Saved per km to better understand user tendencies. Based on this, we created eight unique user segments—such as Frequent Travelers, Bargain Seekers, and Hotel Regulars—and matched each segment to a perk that aligns with their travel behavior.

We then visualized our findings in Tableau dashboards and created a storyboard that illustrates segment profiles and recommended perks.

## 🔑 Key Highlights

🎯 User Base: 5,998 high-engagement users

🧭 Segmentation: 8 user segments crafted from travel and booking behaviors

🎁 Perk Matching: Each segment received a tailored reward (e.g., Free Meal, Priority Check-in)

📊 Visualization: Interactive dashboards created in Tableau for insight sharing
